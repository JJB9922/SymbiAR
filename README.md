# SymbiAR

A simple THREEJS / LOCAR project idea for a product display.


In this scenario, the customer would stand on a specific point. Scan a QR code that leads to the statically hosted version of this site. Then look around to each box (which may be a 3D model of a product). The model will approach their camera for inspection, at which point they can "Shake" it off (lose the cursor) when they are finished.
